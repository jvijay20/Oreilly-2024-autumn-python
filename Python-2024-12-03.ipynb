    "# How do we use a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the `import` statement to use a module, and load it into memory.  The syntax for `import` is a bit strange: It's not a function, so we don't use `()`. It's not like in other languages, where we say what file we want to load. Rather, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import modname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import` doesn't have `()` after it\n",
    "2. The module we want to load isn't in `''`, because it's not a string or a filename. It's the name of the module we want to create.\n",
    "3. Python takes that module name, tacks on a `.py`, and then looks for a file -- in this case, `modname.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we load the module with `import`, we then have a module variable defined (`modname` in this case), and we can access its data and functions via `modname.NAME`, where `NAME` is anything we might want to access in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the module `modname` has a function named `hello`, then after loading `modname`, we can run that function as `modname.hello()`. The `.` indicates that `hello` belongs to the module `modname`. That's the namespace!\n",
    "\n",
    "Module names are case senstive; they are traditionally all in lowercase."
